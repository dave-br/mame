	- Each source_file_paths[i] is a null-terminated string path to a source file.  The
	  first dimension index fits into an unsigned short.
	- line_mappings need not be in any order
	- There may be 0, 1, or more line_mappings entries per source file line number, and only
	  for line numbers corresponding to the first byte of a range of machine-language instruction.
	- No two line_mapping entries should have intersecting address ranges.
	- There is no compiler padding in these structures
