    srcdbg_api.h

	Declarations of public API for manipulating MAME source-level
	debugging information file.

	Only functionality declared in this file and srcdbg_format.h are
	safe for use by tools outside of MAME.
	TODO: URL

    Tools should prefer using this header and linking with
    -lmame_srcdbg_static or -lmame_srcdbg_shared to generate debugging
	info files where possible, instead of directly including
	srcdbg_format.h to manually generate debugging info files.

	This header intentionally written in C to allow C-only tools
    (assemblers, compilers) to #include it.
